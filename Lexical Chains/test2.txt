Water and the Birth of the Solar System

Water was important in the formation of our solar system, especially for the ‘gas giant’ and ‘ice giant’ planets beyond Mars. Star systems form in the clouds of gas, mineral dust, and water drifting through space. A portion of the cloud may separate and collapse under its own weight, sometimes as the result of a massive, nearby exploding star (supernova), as happened with our own Sun. The clues to this trigger event lie within ancient meteorites that have fossil chemical traces of short-lived, highly radioactive isotopes that could only have been generated in a supernova that erupted just prior to our own solar system forming.

As the portion of cloud begins to collapse, any initial movement is converted into a slow rotation of the cloud. As the cloud continues to shrink, it begins to rotate more rapidly. The mass of material now occupies a smaller space, and therefore any original movement is speeded up, much as a skater spins more quickly when they pull their arms in tightly to their body. The compression of the gas in the core of the collapsing cloud begins to release heat, from the release of gravitational energy, and this heats up the interior part of the spinning cloud that is now flattening into a thin disc. The cloud becomes a luminous proto-sun, with a fitful output of heat and light reflecting the growing pains of a star in the making.

The densely packed, colliding atoms at the core of the young star generate temperatures – simply through the immense compression – of millions of degrees Celsius. This compressional heating in itself can 'burn' lithium, atomically transmuting it into beryllium. Eventually – usually after tens of millions of years – the inexorable rise in pressure and temperature makes hydrogen atoms begin to fuse into helium, releasing a truly gargantuan source of energy that can last for billions of years. A true star (or more prosaically, a 'main sequence star') is then born.

Starbirth is a thing of beauty and violence, with intense X-ray emissions and powerful stellar winds of outflowing atoms and ions. The outburst of energy powers the outflow of radiation and gas from the inner parts of the star system, driving them to its outer regions. Shock fronts develop as faster-moving packets of gas driven by these outflows impact upon slower- moving gas patches, causing further heating. The proximity of a just-lit star is no place for a volatile molecule such as water, or ammonia, or carbon dioxide. Hence, a snow line, perhaps a billion kilometres in diameter, is formed around the new star.

Inside the snow line it is too hot for volatile molecules to condense, and they remain as gas – a gas that is driven outwards by the fierce solar wind. It is driven outwards until the temperatures fall so low, somewhere around the present orbit of Jupiter, that it can condense into tiny ice crystals. These can collide and aggregate into large masses of ice as they whirl around the infant Sun. It is a factory where comets are made. Water can build greater things than comets, though.

Water, here, is not simply an icy backdrop to the larger drama of planet formation. It is the motor that drives the manufacture of the largest planets of all: the gas giants of Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giants of Uranus and Neptune. Given that water is a combination of the commonest element in the universe, hydrogen, and the third commonest, oxygen, it is little wonder that it is the commonest molecule, after molecular hydrogen, in these regions. It likely exceeds the amount of metals and silicate minerals in the circumstellar disc.

The scavenging of ice by a growing Jupiter, just in the zone where ice was condensing out of vapour, increased its mass, helping it become massive enough to attract and trap the hydrogen and helium still present in the swirling cloud. In this way, Jupiter grew enormous, as did – although not to quite the same extent – its neighbour Saturn. Farther out from the new Sun's snow line, Uranus and Neptune did not grow large enough to pull in such large amounts of hydrogen. Nevertheless, they accumulated enough water to become 'ice giants' – planets largely made of rock and ice.
