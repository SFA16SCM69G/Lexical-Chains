The Lure of the American West
The Homestead Act of 1862, passed during the Civil War by a Congress free of southern opposition, reflected the ideals and goals of a Republican United States. In keeping with the Jeffersonian vision of a nation of small farmers, the federal government sought to extend the system of individual land ownership west. The Homestead Act, expanding the basic system of settlement established by the Ordinance of 1785, provided a means for privatizing expansive western public lands. Before the Civil War homesteading west of the Mississippi River had proved problematic for individual families, as cheap lands intended for individuals quickly evolved into a commercialized system of land speculation.

The Homestead Act provided title to 160-acre parcels for individuals who made “improvements” to the land over a period of five years. Settlers had the option to purchase the land for $1.25 per acre after the first six months of residency, and some opted to pay up front to secure mortgages to fund improvements. This option encouraged speculation by allowing homesteaded land to be brought into the commercial market a quarter section (one quarter of a square mile) at a time at a higher resale value. Rather than improving the land, homesteaders often sold out to other individuals or commercial farms that grew grain crops over vast acreages.

For those homesteading west of Dodge City, Kansas, on the 100th meridian (the geographic line of aridity where annual rainfalls drop below 8 inches per year), 160 acres required expensive irrigation works for farming or other dry-land farming techniques. These parcels were also far too small for ranching. In addition, five years was too long to develop the land without the benefit of ownership and access to loans. Congress addressed these problems in 1877 with the Desert Lands Act. The act, applicable in eleven western states, allowed for homesteading on 640-acre parcels of arid land at 25 cents per acre and provided title within three years for a dollar an acre for settled, irrigated, land. However, there was no official definition of how much land and water constituted irrigated cultivation. For much of the desert West, agriculture required massive federal support that came with the creation of the Reclamation Service in 1902. The renamed Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) eventually funded extensive irrigation projects in 16 western states. The simple act of providing land and water to farmers and ranchers enormously expanded the growth and reach of the federal government.

It is hard to underestimate the power of perception in the creation of the West as both a geographical region and an ideal with lasting global appeal. In 1895 future president Woodrow Wilson wrote, “The West has been the great word of our history. The Westerner has been the type and master of our American life.” The “great word” was always more myth than truth, not entirely false but a powerful idea with enough fact to motivate millions to move great distances and suffer enormous hardship. The mythic version of the western story is still celebrated in literature, on film, and on TV. But the myth had a dark side. It justified the mistreatment of Indians and their ancestral environment and contributed to class and racial conflict that characterized the post-Civil War West.

At the heart of the mythic story of the West was a question: was the West the land of unlimited opportunity or a paradise lost? Promoters and “boosters” lured settlers, workers, and investors to the region by steadfastly portraying the West as a paradise to be tamed and civilized. Western boosters were masters of public relations and emerging techniques of advertising. Using all of the new mass media at their disposal—dime novels, traveling shows, posters, pamphlets, newspapers, graphic art, and photography—they promoted places that did not yet exist and invented simple solutions to complex cultural and environmental dilemmas. Boosters dismissed the lack of water in much of the region with claims like, “The rain follows the plow.” The faith that ingenuity, technology, and hard work could transform even the wealth was widespread and pushed global migrations to the West.
